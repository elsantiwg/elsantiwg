## üî≠ Proyectos Destacados

### [Multired](https://github.com/elsantiwg/multired)
![Proyecto Asombroso](https://i.imgur.com/IZtLynd.jpeg)
I developed an advanced inventory system called "Multired" using .NET Core MVC. This project offers a comprehensive solution for efficient inventory management, sales, and report generation in PDF and Excel formats. I implemented user roles, advanced security with strong encryption, and a modern and adaptable user interface thanks to Bootstrap. I used Firebase to integrate automatic emails and Swagger to document the system APIs.

KEY FEATURES:
Inventory management with advanced real-time search and visualization features.
Integration with SQL Server for secure and efficient data storage.
Modular development in .NET Core MVC for a scalable and maintainable structure.
Professional report generation in PDF and Excel using DinkToPdf.
Responsive and attractive user interface designed with Bootstrap.
Enhanced security with Isopoh.Cryptography.Argon2 for password protection.
Firebase integration for automatic email dispatch.
Interactive API documentation with Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (Swagger) for easy integration and maintenance.
